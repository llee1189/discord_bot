discord.py is a code written for a discord bot that can play music from YouTube URLs and search up statistics (views,likes) based off a YouTube URL. Mainly trying to practice using Python while associating it with something I use daily. 
Most likely will use this as a skeleton code when I want to make another bot for personal use.  
Possible Improvements:
- A way to improve sound quality: I've used youtubedl and ended up using Discord.utils.Music but both have issues with playback.
- Add pause, replay, loop and other common commands for utilization.
